 * Given an mxn matrix. Each entry is a room. Rooms containing “L” are locked. 
 * No one can enter a locked room. Rooms with “G” are guarded rooms.
 *  Distance of a room from a Guard is defined as the minimum number of rooms
 *  that are encountered for the Guard to reach that room
 *  (Guard can move in all allowed 4 directions at max). 
 *  Find the room that is farthest from all guards. Expected time was O(mn). (Hint: BFS)
