 *Atul is into graph theory, and he is learning about trees nowadays. He observed that the removal of an edge from a given tree T will result in the formation of two separate trees, T1 and T2.

Each vertex of the tree T is assigned a positive integer. Your task is to remove an edge, such that the Tree_diff of the resultant trees is minimized. Tree_diff is defined as the following:

 F(T) = Sum of numbers written on each vertex of a tree T
 Tree_diff(T) = abs(F(T1) - F(T2))
